Nowadays, pricing is generally controlled by powerful algorithms and the airline companies
 make huge profits by utilizing them. So, what are the factors does the algorithms consider for
 ticket pricing? Well, there are many factors such as customer profiling, sales demand, length of
 advance purchase, type of seat chosen, length of the trip and so on which might affect the ticket
 pricing. This grabbed our attention because we might end up getting a cheaper flight if we know
 how these factors influence the price. Due to limited data availability, we are interested mainly in
 a single factor: "Duration of flight" and its relation with airfares. So, by using R-language, we
 performed an exploratory data analysis considering the response variable as airline ticket price
 and explanatory variable as duration and we used a simple linear model to understand the
 relation between the variables by collecting a sample data on a few variables such as price,
 duration of flight, arrival and departure times. Here, our null hypothesis is that there is no
 relationship between the duration of flight and price, while the alternate hypothesis is that there
 is an association between the variables. Additionally, we also generated a multiple regression
 model and validated the predicted prices from both the models under certain assumptions which
 satisfy linearity, independence, normality and equal variance.
